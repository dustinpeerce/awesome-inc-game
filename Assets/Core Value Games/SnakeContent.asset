  gameBeginParagraph: I can build your roof, which will make your house more comfortable.
    But first, I need you to help a friend of mine. Show them how to build a positive
    environment for their clients. Navigating social situations requires finesse.
    As you make connections, it becomes harder to navigate.
  gameEndParagraph: You really know how to bring the fun! You definitely deserve a
    supportive roof for your house. My friend is very grateful as well and agreed
    to help me install the roof. That's why building positive bonds is important,
    as it creates a network of collaboration.
  gameLoseParagraph: That's unfortunate. You have to be quick and responsive when
    dealing with people. Try again when you're ready.
