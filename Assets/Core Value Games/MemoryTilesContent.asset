  gameBeginParagraph: I can build the base of your house. Unfortunately, my exotic
    pets have escaped their enclosures and I can't do anything until they are returned.
    Please help me organize the animals into pairs.
  gameEndParagraph: Thank you so much! I knew from the moment I saw you that you were
    a good, selfless person. There should be more people like you, who use their life
    to benefit the world. I'm happy to build the foundation for your house.
  gameLoseParagraph: Some of the pets got away because you took too long. It's okay,
    I'll get them myself. Try finding the next batch.
