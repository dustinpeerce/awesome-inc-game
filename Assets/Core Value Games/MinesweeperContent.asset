  gameBeginParagraph: "Your house is looking impressive, but you still need the defining
    touches. The decorations in a house are a reflection of your personality. It\u2019s
    only when a person feels cornered that their true personality is revealed. I need
    to see how you react when put in a stressful situation, so let\u2019s sweep for
    mines!"
  gameEndParagraph: Did you feel the tension? Sometimes when you're sweeping for mines,
    you have to make a gut-decision. Being yourself means following your own intuition.
    Now that I have a better understanding of your character, I'll help finish your
    house.
  gameLoseParagraph: Sweeping for mines is a dangerous gig. Don't lose faith though,
    you can do it! Try again when you're ready.

    When you uncover a tile, it will show a number that represents the number of mines
    touching that space.


    If you pinpoint the location of a mine, you can place a flag on that tile as a
    reminder.'
